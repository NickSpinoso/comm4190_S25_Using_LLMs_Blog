    "My Answer: As someone who has played all their life I would disagree with a lot of this. Of course it depends on what your goals are, if they are to just literally get a little better at basketball this is fine. But If it is for someone who is trying to make a team or play competitively this is not great advice. The most important thing is playing basketball like game simulation or scrimmage. I would recommend 30 minutes of all the other stuff and then 30 minutes of playing or more. The best way to get better at basketball is to play it because those skill drills can only do so much. "
