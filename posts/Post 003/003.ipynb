    "My Answer: I am very passionate about this argument between Michael Jordan and Lebron James. I believe that Lebron is the best basketball player ever. I actually went back and asked who the best basketball player is and not the greatest and what AI said  is exactly how I feel. I feel that the greatest is Michael Jordan but the best is Lebron. Lebron is the most well rounded player the game has ever seen and he has been elite for 20 years professionally. Jordan is the greatest because he went a perfect 6-0 in the NBA Finals and was ahead of his time in the things he was doing on the court. Everyone wanted to be ‚ÄúLike Mike‚Äù "

    "My Answer: So unlike a layup I think Chat got this one pretty spot on. Although I do not play baseball in college I did grow up playing it and was very involved for most of my life. I would also say that every swing is different, there is a general consensus you should be balanced and keep your hands steady and through the strike zone. But timing, foot placement, bat placement and even your overall stance varies from player to player. "
