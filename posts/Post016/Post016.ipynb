    "The answer to **‚Äúbest college basketball team‚Äù** also depends on context‚Äî**historically**, **right now**, or **in a single dominant season**. Here's a quick breakdown of each:\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üèÜ All-Time Best College Basketball Program\n",
    "\n",
    "**University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA Bruins)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Championships**: 11 NCAA titles (10 under legendary coach John Wooden)\n",
    "* **Why**: They dominated the sport from the 1960s through the 1970s, including **seven straight titles** (1967‚Äì1973), which may never be matched.\n",
    "* **Notable players**: Kareem Abdul-Jabbar (then Lew Alcindor), Bill Walton\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üî• Best Team *Right Now* (2024‚Äì2025 Season)\n",
    "\n",
    "**University of Connecticut (UConn Huskies)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Why**: They won back-to-back national championships in 2023 and 2024, showing dominant, well-rounded play. Head coach Dan Hurley has turned UConn into a powerhouse again with defense, rebounding, and tough-minded players.\n",
    "* **Notable players**: Donovan Clingan, Tristen Newton, Stephon Castle (2024 season)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí£ Most Dominant Single-Season Team\n",
    "\n",
    "**2011‚Äì12 Kentucky Wildcats**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Record**: 38‚Äì2\n",
    "* **Championship**: 2012 NCAA title\n",
    "* **Why**: Loaded with future NBA stars like Anthony Davis, Michael Kidd-Gilchrist, and Terrence Jones, this team dominated both ends of the court and had size, athleticism, and defense unmatched in their year.\n",
