    "My Answer: I have noticed with questions like this they always “play both sides” which is a really good thing I think. It gives you the pros and cons to everything. I personally am not someone who believes a lot in that stuff but I am not one of the people who absolutely hate on it. So it is interesting to see that both can get approval."
