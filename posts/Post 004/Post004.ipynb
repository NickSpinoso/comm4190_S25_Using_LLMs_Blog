    "My Answer: I asked Chat to choose one and Norway was the one that was chosen. I find this really interesting because it is such an impossible question to answer. I feel like even if you were to live in every country you wouldn‚Äôt get the entire feel for it because of either a language barrier or a time period or something else. Seeing what Chat used to decide this is very interesting. Also noticing there is absolutely no countries from Africa or South America makes me think that these are the least populated or technologically advanced continents and that it has to do with that. Maybe that is not entirely true but I feel like it has something to do with it."
